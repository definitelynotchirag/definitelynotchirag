<h1 align="center">Chirag</h1>
<p align="center">Full Stack Developer focused on Generative AI and practical shipped products</p>

---

### What I Do
I build end to end systems that combine:
- Next.js and Tailwind for fast product UI
- LangChain and LLMs for Generative AI features
- Python and Node backends for actual business logic that is not tutorial level
- MongoDB and Postgres depending on scale and structure
- Telegram bots that ship fast and solve problems instead of looking pretty

If something needs to go from idea to working product without crying about architecture for 3 weeks, I can handle it.

---

### Current Focus
- Building real Generative AI features with LangChain
- Strengthening backend architecture and reliability
- Improving ML fundamentals with small but consistent projects

---

### Projects Worth Looking At
| Project | What it Proves |
|---------|-----------------|
| **ChatX** | Full stack AI chat app with LangChain, production auth, and data handling |
| **Placement Predictor** | Python ML pipeline and web integration that does not fall apart on real data |
| **HackScrapped** | Scraper and workflow automation built for actual use not demo screenshots |

(Replace these with your real repo links and keep the explanations sharp)

---

### Skills That Actually Matter
- Full Stack Dev: Next.js, React, Tailwind, Node.js, Prisma
- Backend and Infra: REST, MongoDB, Postgres, basic Docker use
- AI and ML: Python, LangChain, supervised learning basics, model integration
- Automation: Telegram bots, data workflows, scrapers

I am not listing every tool I have ever touched. Only the ones I can defend.
